The Colbert Report,11,1447,8.4,39000,327.6,English,"The Colbert Report is an American satirical late night television program that airs Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a ""well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot"", is a caricature of televised political pundits.

The Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term ""truthiness"", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year.","News, Comedy","Busboy Productions, Spartina Productions",2005-2014,"Stephen Colbert: Self - Host …, Jay Katsir: Jay the Intern …, Jon Stewart: Self …, Paul Dinello: Tad …, Trevor Potter: Self …, Andrew Sullivan: Self …, Neil deGrasse Tyson: Self …, Tim Meadows: P.K.

The television program centers around the larger than life death metal band Dethklok, and often portrays dark and macabre content, including such subjects as violence, death, and the drawbacks of fame, with extremely hyperbolic black humor; which accounts for the cartoon's consistent TV-MA rating. The show can be seen as both a parody and celebration of heavy metal culture.

The music, written by guitarist/creator Brendon Small, is credited to the band, and is featured in most of the episodes. The animation is often carefully synced to the music, with the chord positions and fingering of the guitar parts shown in some detail.

One of the trademarks of the show is having the usual ""bleeps"" for extreme profanity replaced by pinch harmonics.","Animation, Comedy","Williams Street, Titmouse",2006-2012,"Brendon Small: Nathan Explosion …, Tommy Blacha: Toki Wartooth …, Mark Hamill: Senator Stampingston …, Victor Brandt: General Crozier …, Malcolm McDowell: Vater Orlaag …, Laraine Newman: News Anchor …, George Fisher: Metal Masked Assassin …, Werner Herzog: Ishnifus Meaddle, Kirk Hammett: Barkeep …, Janeane Garofalo: Abigail Remeltindrinc","band, americans, government, fame, heavy, world, william, organization, destroy, big, adventure, situation, famous, deal, successful, death, life",tt0839188,Adult Swim,United States

Andy Griffith portrays the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His life is complicated by an inept, but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee, and a precocious young son, Opie. Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: ""Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.""

The series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry.

The series began as a feature on YouTube and later became a program on ScrewAttack Entertainment before moving to GameTrailers exclusively. The show was renamed The Angry Video Game Nerd to prevent any trademark issues with Nintendo and due to the fact he started reviewing games from non-Nintendo consoles such as those made by Atari and Sega.

Rolfe's character, ""The Nerd"" is a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic.

The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped before a live studio audience at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented ""in living color"" during the 1950s and 1960s, prior to mainstream color television. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast were black, unlike other sketch comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live whose casts are usually mostly white.

Other members of the Wayans family—Kim, Shawn and Marlon—had regular roles, while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred the previously unknown actor/comedians Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, and David Alan Grier.

The fourth incarnation of the Tonight Show franchise made its debut on May 25, 1992, three days following Johnny Carson's retirement as host of the program. The program originates from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and is broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35 PM in the Eastern and Pacific time zones. Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once utilized a guest host, preferring to host the series by himself.

On April 26, 1999, the show began broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition. The show is shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.

The series, which followed the same basic format as that of his predecessors, ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien. NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot.

The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien,1,146,8.0,9200,73.6,English,"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show that featured Conan O'Brien as host from June 1, 2009 to January 22, 2010 as part of NBC's long-running Tonight Show franchise. The program's host, Conan O'Brien, previously hosted NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which followed The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for 16 years, until O'Brien's brief succession over Leno.

Many members of the Late Night cast and crew made the transition to The Tonight Show. The Max Weinberg 7, the house band from O'Brien's Late Night, served as the house band under the new name, Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. Andy Richter returned to the show as announcer, and also began resuming his role as sidekick, shortly before the show's conclusion. The opening and closing theme song from Late Night was also carried over to Tonight, in a slightly altered form.

In January 2010, after the show had been on the air for seven months, it was announced that NBC was intending to move Jay Leno from primetime back to his original timeslot at 11:35 pm, with O'Brien's show starting shortly after midnight. In response to the announcement, O'Brien released a press statement saying that he would not continue as host of The Tonight Show if it was moved to any time after midnight to accommodate The Jay Leno Show. He feared it would ruin the long and rich tradition of The Tonight Show. It had been on after the late local newscasts from the beginning. After two weeks of negotiations, NBC announced that they had paid $45 million to buy out O'Brien's contract, ending both his tenure as host as well as his relationship with NBC after 22 years.","Talk, Comedy","Universal Media Studios, Conaco",2009-2010,"Conan O'Brien: Self - Host, The Tonight Show Band: Themselves - House Band, Andy Richter: Self - Announcer, Jimmy Vivino: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Guitar …, Jerry Vivino: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Saxophone …, Richie 'La Bamba' Rosenberg: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Trombone, James Wormworth: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Percussion, Mark 'Love Man' Pender: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Trumpet, Mike Merritt: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Bass, Scott Healy: Self - The Tonight Show Band: Keyboards","interview, musical, feature, open",tt0899126,NBC,United States
